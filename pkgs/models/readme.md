# Models
This directory contains the model architectures used throughout the experiments.

Given that experiments follow the methodology of [Roth et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08473), the ResNet architecture is a direct adoption from [their implementation](https://github.com/Confusezius/Revisiting_Deep_Metric_Learning_PyTorch/tree/master/architectures), and found in [roth.py](./roth.py).

[VisualPhishNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00300) is an adoption from [the implementation](https://github.com/S-Abdelnabi/VisualPhishNet) (originally in TensorFlow), that have been translated and made available in PyTorch.
